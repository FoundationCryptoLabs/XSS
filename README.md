About

XSS is a a capital-efficient stablecoin system with an explicit and autonomous redemption price adjustment mechanism, offering a practical way for ensuring mid-and-long term stability & value appreciation of the currency. It is aimed at solving the twin problems of inflation of current stable assets (USDC, DAI, RAI), as well as high volatility in appreciating assets (BTC). We approach this problem by designing an explicit peg to an algorithmic measure of stable/appreciating purchasing power, instead of pegging directly to USD (loses purchasing power), or a scarce asset like BTC (too volatile).

xBTC protocol is governed by the EVI DAO, which sets the XSR savings rate as a further mechanism to stabilise price and earn protocol revenue. For more information on the protocol, check out the Technical Documentation and the Whitepaper.
